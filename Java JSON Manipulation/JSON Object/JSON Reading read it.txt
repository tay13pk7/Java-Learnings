{
  "message":"Hi",
  "place":{"name":"world"}
}

// This is a normal JSON 


for practice convert this JSON into this format means that is the json we could use for practice

("{\"message\":\"Hi\",\"place\":{\"name\":\"World!\"}}");


-----------------------------------------------------



JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
It consists of key-value pairs, where the value can be a string, number, object, array, boolean, or null.

{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}


There are three elements. Each key-value pair constitutes one element, and there are three such pairs:

Element 1: Key "name", Value "John"
Element 2: Key "age", Value 30
Element 3: Key "city", Value "New York"
So, the total number of elements in this JSON object is three.

There are two libraries for JSONArray

import com.google.gson.JsonArray;
import org.json.simple.JSONArray;
